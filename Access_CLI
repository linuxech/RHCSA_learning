1) Access the CLI

A command line is a text-based interface that is used to input instructions to a computer system.
The Linux command line is provided by a program called the shell.

The default user shell in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is the GNU Bourne-Again Shell
(bash). The bash shell is an improved version of the original Bourne Shell (sh) on UNIX
systems.

Example: 
 [user@host ~]$

$ --> When a regular user starts a shell, the prompt includes an ending dollar ($) character

 [root@host ~]$#

(#) --> A hash (#) character replaces the dollar ($) character when the shell is running as the superuser,
root.

Shell Basics
Commands that are entered at the shell prompt have three basic parts:
• Command to run.
• Options to adjust the behavior of the command.
• Arguments, which are typically targets of the command.

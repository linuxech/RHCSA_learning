1) Linux

Linux s actually a Kernal. Linux is a critical technology for IT professionals to understand.

Linux provides the core technologies that power the
cloud revolution and the tools to build the latest generations of container-based microservices
applications, software-based storage technologies, and big data solutions.

- What makes linux great?

-- Linux is open source software.
-- Liux provides a command-line interface (CLI) for easy access and powerful scripting.
-- Linux is a modular operating system that is designed to easily replace or remove components.

2) Red Hat

Red Hat is the world's leading provider of open source software solutions, by using a community-
powered approach to reliable and high-performance cloud, Linux, middleware, storage, and
virtualization technologies.

Red Hat is best known for its participation in the Linux community and the Red Hat Enterprise
Linux distribution. However, Red Hat is also active in other open source communities, including
middleware projects that are centered on the JBoss developer community, virtualization solutions,
cloud technologies such as OpenStack and OpenShift, and the Ceph and Gluster software-based
storage projects, plus others.

3) Open Source

Open source software is software with source code that anyone can use, study, modify, and share.

Open Source - Whos source code is freely accessible. 
Closed Source - Whos source code is available but is dependent on properietry hardware. 


Open source has many benefits for the user:
• Control: See what the code does and improve it.
• Training: Learn from real-world code and develop more useful applications.
• Security: Inspect sensitive code, and fix it even without the original developers' help.
• Stability: Rely on code that can survive the loss of the original developer.

4) Types of Licenses

The developers of open source software can license their software in different ways. The software
license terms control how the source can be combined with other code or reused. To be open
source, licenses must allow users to freely use, view, change, compile, and distribute the code.

To general Open Source License

- Copyleft license are designed to encourage keeping the code open source. 
- Permissive licenses are designed to maximize code reusability. 

- Some of the common copyleft license include the GNU General Public License(GPL) and the Lesser 
GNU Public License (LGPL).

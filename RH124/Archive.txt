Archive and Transfer File

-- What is archive?

An archive is a single file or device file that contains multiple files.

-- Why use archive?

To compress the backup files to reduce the storage consumption. 

--Utilities

Tar Utilities

General Options --	

• -c or --create : Create an archive file.
• -t or --list : List the contents of an archive.
• -x or --extract : Extract an archive.

The following tar command general options are commonly included:
• -v or --verbose : Show the files being archived or extracted during the tar operation.
• -f or --file : Follow this option with the archive file name to create or open.
• -p or --preserve-permissions : Preserve the original file permissions when extracting.
• --xattrs : Enable extended attribute support, and store extended file attributes.
• --selinux : Enable SELinux context support, and store SELinux file contexts.

Archive with which algorithm

The following tar command compression options are used to select an algorithm:
• -a or --auto-compress : Use the archive's suffix to determine the algorithm to use.
• -z or --gzip : Use the gzip compression algorithm, resulting in a .tar.gz suffix.
• -j or --bzip2 : Use the bzip2 compression algorithm, resulting in a .tar.bz2 suffix.
• -J or --xz : Use the xz compression algorithm, resulting in a .tar.xz suffix.
• -Z or --compress : Uses an LZ-variant algorithm, resulting in a .tar.Z suffix.

Task -- Compress multiple folders and create an archive and run the process in background.

Transfer files

The OpenSSH suite is useful for securely running shell commands on remote systems. Use the
Secure File Transfer Program (SFTP) to interactively upload to or download files from an SSH
server. This program is part of the OpenSSH suite.

For transfer the same file for first time. 

rsync  -- Do not overwrite the file by consuming the kernel resources. Better than scp/sftp. the tool uses an algorithm that 
		minimizes the amount of copied data by syncing only the changed portions of files.
sftp/scp -- Do not use any modern algorithm. Overwrite the whole file. 

Task -- login to Sftp and transfer the file to the current machine from the other test machine.

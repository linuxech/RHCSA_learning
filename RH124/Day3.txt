Understanding Tab use

Tab will allow you to autocomplete the filename/directory name that is available. 

- Press Tab Once = will autocomplete the file name.
- Press Tab Twice= will show the possible matches file/directroy

#Also, for directory the directory name will end with /(forward Slash)
#Note if space is being added when you type Tab, as it will shows that there are another files with same name.

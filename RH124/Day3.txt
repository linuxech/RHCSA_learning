Understanding Tab use

Tab will allow you to autocomplete the filename/directory name that is available. 

- Press Tab Once = will autocomplete the file name.
- Press Tab Twice= will show the possible matches file/directroy

#Also, for directory the directory name will end with /(forward Slash)
#Note if space is being added when you type Tab, as it will shows that there are another files with same name.

File System

The Linux system stores all files on file systems, which are organized into a single
inverted tree known as a file-system hierarchy.

Important Directories

Location				 Purpose
/boot					Files to start the boot process.
/dev					Special device files that the system uses to access hardware.
/etc					System-specific configuration files.
/home					Home directory, where regular users store their data and configuration files.
/root					Home directory for the administrative superuser, root.
/run					Runtime data for processes that started since the last boot. This data includes
					process ID files and lock files. The contents of this directory are re-created on
					reboot. This directory consolidates the /var/run and /var/lock directories
					from earlier versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
/tmp					A world-writable space for temporary files. Files that are not accessed, changed,
					or modified for 10 days are deleted from this directory automatically. The /var/
					tmp directory is also a temporary directory, in which files that are not accessed,
					changed, or modified in more than 30 days are deleted automatically.
/usr					Installed software, shared libraries, including files, and read-only program data.
					Significant subdirectories include:
					• /usr/bin: User commands
					• /usr/sbin: System administration commands
					• /usr/local: Locally customized software
/var					System-specific variable data should persist between boots. Files that
					dynamically change, such as databases, cache directories, log files, printerspooled documents, and website content, might be found under /var.

Important

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and later, four older directories in / have identical
contents to their counterparts in /usr:
• /bin and /usr/bin
• /sbin and /usr/sbin
• /lib and /usr/lib
• /lib64 and /usr/lib64

Earlier versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux had distinct directories with different
sets of files. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and later, the directories in / are symbolic
links to the matching directories in /usr.

Absolute Vs Relative Path

Absolute Path

An absolute path is a fully qualified name that specifies the exact location of the file in the
file system hierarchy. 

The absolute path begins at the root (/) directory and includes each
subdirectory that must be traversed to reach the specific file. Every file in a file system has a
unique absolute path name, recognized with a simple rule: a path name with a forward slash (/) as
the first character is an absolute path name.


Relative Path

a relative path identifies a unique location, and specifies only the
necessary path to reach the location from the working directory.

Relative path names follow a simple rule: a path name with anything other than a forward slash as the first character is a relative
path name. For example, relative to the /var directory, the message log file is log/messages.

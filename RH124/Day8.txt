Control Access to files

- Normal Permission
- Special Permission

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
What is file ownership?

Ownership is the info about the user/individual who own/created the file/directroy.

When you run ls -l

Effects of Permissions on Files and Directories
Permission		Effect on files				Effect on directories
r (read)		File contents can beread.		Contents of the directory (the file names) can be listed.
w (write)		File contents can be changed.		Any file in the directory can be created or deleted.
x (execute)		Files can be executed as commands.	The directory can become the current working directory. 
								You can run the cd command to it, but it also requires 
								read permission to list files there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example:
[user@host ~]$ ls -ld /home

drwxr-xr-x. 5 root root 4096 Feb 31 22:00 /home

The first character of the long listing is the file type, and is interpreted as follows:
• - is a regular file.
• d is a directory.
• l is a symbolic link.
• c is a character device file.
• b is a block device file.
• p is a named pipe file.
• s is a local socket file.

Managing Permissions

- Symbolic 
- Octal

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Octal

# Change Permissions with the Symbolic Method
Use the chmod command to modify file and directory permissions. The following example can help
you to understand the chmod command usage:

chmod Who/What/Which file|directory

Who is the class of user, as in the following table. If you do not provide a class of user, then the
chmod command uses the all group as default.

Who		 Set			Description
u		 user			The file owner.
g		 group			Member of the file's group.
o		 other			Users who are not the file owner nor members of the file's group.
a		 all			All the three previous groups.

#What is the operator that modifies the Which, as in the table below.

What		Operation			Description
+		add				Adds the permissions to the file.
-		remove				Removes the permissions to the file.
=		set exactly			Set exactly the provided permissions to the file.

#Which is the mode, and specifies the permissions to the files or directories, as in the table below.
Which			Mode			Description
r			read			Read access to the file. Listing access to the directory.
w			write			Write permissions to the file or directory.
x			execute			Execute permissions to the file. Allows to enter the directory, and access 
						files and subdirectories inside the directory.
X			special execute		Execute permissions for a directory, or execute permissions to a file 
						if it has at least one of the execute bits set.

Change Permissions with the Octal Method

You can use the chmod command to change file permissions with the octal method instead of the
symbolic method. In the following example, the # character represents a digit.

chmod ### file|directory

With the octal method, you can represent permissions as a 3-digit (or 4-digit, when setting
advanced permissions) octal number. A single octal digit can represent any single value from 0-7.

In the 3-digit octal representation of permissions, each digit stands for one access level, from left
to right: user, group, and other. To determine each digit:

• Start with 0.
• Read permissions for this access level, then add 4.
• Write permissions, then add 2.
• Execute permissions, then add 1

The following list shows some examples for changing permissions with the octal method:

Set read and write permissions for user, and read permission for group and other, on the
sample.txt file:

[user@host ~]$ chmod 644 sample.txt

Set read, write, and execute permissions for user, read and execute permissions for group, and no
permission for other on the sampledir directory:

[user@host ~]$ chmod 750 sampledir

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

#By defaut the directory have the execute permission. 
#File does not have the execute permission by default, untill unless assigned otherwise. 


#Directory execute permission allows the user to enter into the directory.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Special Permission

Special permissions are a fourth permission type in addition to the basic user, group, and other types.


Effects of Special Permissions on Files and Directories
Permission 			Effect on files 				Effect on directories
u+s (suid) 			File executes as the user that owns the file, 
				not as the user that ran the file.		No effect

g+s (sgid) 			File executes as the group that owns the file.	Files that are created in the directory 
										have a group owner to match the group 
										owner of the directory.

o+t (sticky) 			No effect. 					Users with write access to the directory can
										remove only files that they own; they cannot 
										remove or force saves to files that other user own.
T --- Means that execute permission was already there.and is no longer available.
t --- Means that execute permission is now available.

# Service Vs Daemon
 Search about it. 


.service extension is the default extension of systemd. 

On-Demand Service 
.socket
.path


• Service units have a .service extension and represent system services. You can use service units to start frequently accessed daemon,such as a web server.

• Socket units have a .socket extension and represent inter-process communication (IPC) sockets that systemd should monitor. If a client connects to the socket, then the systemd manager starts a daemon and passes the connection to it. You can use socket units to delay the start of a service at boot time and to start less frequently used services on demand.

• Path units have a .path extension and delay the activation of a service until a specific filesystem change occurs. You can use path units for services that use spool directories, such as a printing system.

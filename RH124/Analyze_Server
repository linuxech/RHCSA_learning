What is web console?

The web console is a web-based management interface for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which is
designed for managing and monitoring your servers, and is based on the open-source Cockpit
service.

You can use the web console to monitor system logs and to view graphs of system performance.
Additionally, you can use your web browser to change settings by using graphical tools in the web
console interface, including a fully-functional interactive terminal session.

It is not used often in Industry because most often we use terminal instead.

In order to monitor and analyse server, we need to install the on demand service cockpit.

You can access the GUI based dashboard of Cockpit from the port 9090 with system IP.

Monitor and Manage Linux Processes

#What is Process?

A process is a running instances of a launched, executable program. 

A process is instance of a program/application that execute to acheive a functionality. 

#Characterstics of Process

- Program Code 
- Data --> Associated with Prgram
- System Resource --> CPU,Memory
- Execution State --> Ruuning | Stop/Halt | Waiting/Sleeping | Zombie

#Process Life Cycle
- Creation
- Execution
- Waiting -- For resources
- Termination -- If a process is forcefully closed, may result in Zombie process(Keeps the PID but the process is closed)

#Jobs Vs Processes
##systemd -- Always Start at first PID-1##
#Background and Foreground Parameter

- Foreground Process execution
	The process that runs and give output on the terminal screen are foreground process/jobs
Example-- pwd and ls

- Background Process execution
	The process that runs in the background either by running a foreground command, that keeps running to complete the jobs.
Example-- Copying a big file using cp. 


#Monitoring and Managing Linux Processes

- TOP -- Realtime Dynamic Monitoring Example: RAM, CPU Load, 
- PS -- Process State of running state. 

*Kill -- If CPU overloads
*Jobs -- to move the Background and Foreground process


-------------------------------------------------------
##
Jobs

run the command/job in the background or Foreground.

bg %1

syntax- bg %(jobsID)

Example:
sleep 1001 &

This command will run the sleep command in the background. 

-- Kill -9 -- Forcefully Kill/Not recommended.
-- Kill -15 -- Gracefully kill

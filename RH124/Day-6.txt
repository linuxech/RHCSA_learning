User

A user account provides security boundaries between different people and programs that can run
commands.

- the superuser-- The superuser account administers the system. The superuser name is root and the account
has a UID of 0. The superuser has full system access.

- system users-- The system user accounts are used by processes that provide supporting services. These
processes, or daemons, usually do not need to run as the superuser. They are assigned nonprivileged accounts to secure their files and other resources from each other and from regular
users on the system. Users do not interactively log in with a system user account.

- regular users-- Most users have regular user accounts for their day-to-day work. Like system users, regular
users have limited access to the system.

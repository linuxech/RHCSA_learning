Manage SELinux Security

SELinux was developed by the NSA US. 
The main goal is to secure system/File/Port. 

Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a critical security feature of Linux. Access to files, ports, and other resources 
is controlled at a granular level. Processes are permitted to access only the resources that their SELinux policy or 
Boolean settings specify.

The policy is known as Target Policy. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Manadatory Access Control -- 
Can be used to restrict even Root users. 
Available in SELinux. 
Top Level/Granular Level Security

Discretionary  Access Control -- Allows root user to be super user. Tradtional Security.


Features				DAC							MAC

Control Ownership			File Owner					Admin/Policy
Flexibility				More Flexible/Less Security			Less Flexible/Highly Secure
	Example				chmod and chown	etc				SELinux
Root User Control			root can access all things.			Root is restricted
Policy					Permission based, No policy			Strict Policy
-------------------------------------------------------------------

SELinux has the following operational modes:
• Enforcing : SELinux enforces the loaded policies. This mode is the default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
• Permissive : SELinux loads the policies and is active, but instead of enforcing access control rules, 
it logs access violations. This mode is helpful for testing and troubleshooting applications and rules.
• Disabled : SELinux is turned off. SELinux violations are not denied or logged. Disabling SELinux is strongly discouraged.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

sestatus			\\ To check status of SELinux

setenforce			\\ To set enforce of SELinux

#How to change the SELinux from config file. 

-- vim /etc/selinux/config
	-- Go to line 22 --SELINUX=enforcing			\\Make changes in this line.
setenforce 1			\\Man and learn about it. 
getenforce			\\Man and learn about it. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Practice the enforcement of SELinux.
